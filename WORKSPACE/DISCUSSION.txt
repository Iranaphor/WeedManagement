So what is needed....
welp...
the image contains 3 components
the carrot, weed and dirt
the dirt can be extracted by colour & hue
so what remains is differentiating between 
the types of leaves...
so what differences are there
?
Weeds:
	- larger leaves
	- extent(area/boundingbox)

Carrots:
	- spikier leaves
	- low solidity
